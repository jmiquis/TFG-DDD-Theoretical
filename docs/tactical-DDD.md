# Tactical DDD 🏗️
--- 

Once we have made our strategic analysis, it's time to start building our app. 
Tactical DDD it's more about coding, using patterns, things that we all really want to do 😜... but once again I have seen this point repeated many times during my research : no strategic DDD = absolute fail; 📛

DDD tactical patterns:

- value object 🧱
- entities 🧍
- aggregates 👪
- repositories 🏨
- services 🐕‍🦺
- events 🥳
