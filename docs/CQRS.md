# CQRS  ⤴ ➡️ ⤵️

Command/Query Responsability Segregation is a pattern in which requests that ask form some data (queries) are split from the request that only want to change the app's state (commands).
As DDD itself, the work that takes this procedure has to worth only if we have a high concurrency, increasing our performance.
Also as domain events, it helps us to monitorize the request made to our app.
Axon provides us channels to carry out this pattern in a simple way
