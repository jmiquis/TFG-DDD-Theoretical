# Introduction to DDD, hexagonal architecture and CQRS with Spring Boot and Axon  üë∂ üìñ

### This is an introductive information research in order to lay my foundations about this software developement approach as final project to obtain my software development HNC üë®‚Äçüéì
-----
This is MY experience after months of studying DDD, hexagonal architecture and CQRS
I have taken info from many different sources, which are pretty referenced on the bibliography part.

There is a [practical back](https://github.com/jmiquis/TFG-DDD-demo) to this report.
